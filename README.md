# 19: User Directory
## Description
A react directory that allows the user to view their entire employee directory at once for quick access. 
# User Story

* AS a user, I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
# Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Installation
* npm init
* install 
* axios
* react
* react bootstrap and dom


## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
